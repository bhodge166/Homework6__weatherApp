#WeatherApp
This code is for a simple weather app. The app takes the user input and uses the openweather api to get current weather and a 5 day forecast for the users city of choice. Current Weather and forecast are placed on the page dynamically. The users search is saved to local storage and can be accessed again via a dynamically placed button with the city name on it. The styling is all done with bootstrap.

Screenshot of finished work can be seen below:
